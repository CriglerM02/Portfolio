            <h2>This website!</h2>
            <p>Instead of using other website/portfolio building tools, I decided to hard-code my portfolio website in order to achieve a level of customizability and editability that I desired to show off my skills and projects</p>

        <h2>Dead Code</h2>
        <p>One of the first websites I made, short and sweet. I made this website for an assignment about Webtexts. I decided to take an experimental route, playing with CSS and text animation to frame a poem about my experience with burnout during my education.</p>

        <h2>Fake sushi resaurant website</h2>
            <p>The final project of my Web programming class, the task was to implement the ordering and kitchen endpoints of a sushi restaurant using Flask and SQLalchemy. The ordering endpoint shows the menu and stores the orders, while the kitchen can view all curent orders and can delete them.</p>

        <h2>A Tomb of Steel and Silicon</h2>
            <p>This was a game I was inspired to make after one of my classes discussed the ethics and our personal opinions and concerns about a life after death through technology. Many people in the class were hesitant when it came to preserving their consciousness in a computer and I decided to frame this apprehension as a simple horror game built in the twine engine.</p>

        <h2>Strike Steel - sound design</h2>
        <p>This was my first capstone project for my senior year. I worked with a partner to create a game that took place during the Homestead Steel Strike. My role was to create sounds and music to match this environment and show the feelings of the parties involved in the strike while creating satisyfing interactions for users.</p>

        <h2>Anxious Architect - Art and sound design</h2>
        <p>For part of my senior capstone classes I worked on this project with a team to create a game about managing anxiety. My role on the team was art, including UIs, and sound. I designed various game environments and characters and created music and sourced sound effects for the gameplay. I wanted to make the UIs in this game to match the vibe of the game, so great care was taken to create interfaces that can be read and navigated easily while being aesthetically pleasing and creating a specific, visual vibe.</p>
