      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh, recieving a B.S. in Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (DNID) with a minor in Computer Engineering. While studying, most of my extracurricular time was spent with the University of Pittsburgh Varsity Marching Band, where I played the Baritone. With my education, I hope to combine my studies in DNID with my passion for music by exploring topics such as the role of audio in narrative and in user interface and user experience design.</p>
      <h2>Skills</h2> <!-- Cut section maybe? keep landing page clean, concise. Probably a show, don't tell situation.-->
      <p>During my time at Pitt, I have used many programming languages. For my major, I have used Java, Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. For my minor, I have used Matlab, C, C++, Assembly, and worked with hardware description languages, like VHDL, as well. I have also used a variety of software, including Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Audition, Premier Pro. and After Effects.  </p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>My projects are mostly game and web design, my goal in each one is to use code in a creative setting, something that I hope to continue doing in the future. Another goal I had with many of my projects is to combine my coding expertise with other topics that I am passionate about, such as music and mental health.</p>
